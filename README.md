# My BDLI Journey ðŸš€

It has been three weeks since I joined the **Bonny Digital Literacy Initiative (BDLI)** program, and the experience has been both exciting and impactful for me.  

Before joining BDLI, I only knew a few things about computers. Since starting the program, I have gained **basic computing skills** that help me understand how a computer works and how to use it effectively.

So far, we have learned **basic computing skills**, how to use **Microsoft word**, and how to create slides with **PowerPoint**. These skills are already helping me work better with computers and prepare for more advanced lessons ahead. 

What I love most about BDLI is that the learning environment is friendly and supportive. The trainers explain things clearly, and my fellow participants are always ready to help one another. Itâ€™s more than just a computer class â€” it feels like a community where we all grow together.  

I am looking forward to the coming weeks as we explore more areas of technology and gain skills that will help me make a positive difference in my community.
